# CLPT14 - HEPTA-SAT Training 

## What is CLPT?
CLPT stands for the CanSat Leader Training Program. It is an intensive hands-on training program organized by UNISEC (University Space Engineering Consortium), Japan.

The program is designed to train trainersâ€”meaning participants not only learn how to design, build, test, and launch small educational satellites (CanSats), but also how to teach others to do the same in their own countries or institutions.

The 14th round of this training is coined as CLPT14 took place at Nihon University between 19 to 30 August 2025. This round of training was centred around the HEPTA-SAT training KIT  - a hands-on small satellite training kit developed by Professor Masahiko Yamazaki at Nihon University, in Japan.

# Training Method
This was a competnace based training with large percentage of time dedicated to the hands-on. The training was divided into three main parts. The first part involved  participants completing the six (6) practical labs in the first three days. The second part was project based learning where four teams were formed and each team developed a mission, desinged, implemented and tested/verified the satellite project. This included spending a full day sourcing the components for the mission from various shops in Tokyo. The last part was Teaching Practice where all participants were involved in training the students for two days.
